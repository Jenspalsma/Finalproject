# **Steppup** Application / Consultancy  website 
## Project Specifications

__- What is the problem you are trying to solve?__
__- Who is your target audience?__
__- What are your specific goals?__


The IT industry is booming, alot of companies are coming out of the ground and start there business. But also alot of them fail because of many different reasons like: Money problems, lack of good management, wrong decisions etcetc. A helping hand can be really change there perspective about the directions the companies need to follow. We will consult companies so they can forfill there goals. 

The target audience is mainly (tech) start-ups. Alot of entheupheuneurs start a company because the have an idea that they want to put into practise. But most of them don't know all the IT part of it. The can use help in finding the best way to build there websites and market there product. We will provide them with our knowledge so they can make the right decisions and save money that they otherwise might have invested wrong. 

Our goal is to become a well know'n player in the it consultancy business. To be really appricieted by alot of companies that we helped with consultancy. in the first half of 2019 we want to have been helped at least 10 companies.



__What is your business model? Where is your revenue coming from?__


As uasual in consulting you get paid by the our. So first we need to find some clients and asstablish a good name in the industry. When we get some jobs from start-ups or other companies then we need to bill them for our consultancy services. The ammount of the hourly rate we still need to discuss about but IT will be between the â‚¬80-150 per hour. 



__What are the costs of your business?__

Here is a breakdown of the team that we would need to eventually hire to make
this business work:

#### Staffing / professionals 

To give the right advise about different IT project's we need to hire the right people. This can be done on freelance basse but also we have alot of knowlegde within our networks already. For each job that comes in we need to see what's reasonable for the team to make it happen. We might need to hire some freelamcers also for difficult projects or projects that are not our speciality. 


#### Advertising

Once the website is online costumers need to come and need to find us. From experience of our team we can tell that consultancy is a peoples business. For advertising its therefore very inportant to connect with alot of people and on this way to found out if they can actually use our help. Consulting needs to go from the one person to the other. It's really good to have the website but the best way to get the jobs is to attend alot of network conferences and talk to alot of people. Furthermore we will be doing some advertising asswell on the internet to check if thats working out asswell.

#### Website Accuracy

It is important that all of the information on the website is correct and up to date (to avoid potential customer disappointment).

#### Customer Service

We will handle the costumer service by ourselfses. Costumer care does't take that much of time in a consulting business. Just need to make sure that if we got requests from customers that we need to answer them quickly ans professionaly. 

The disscions that we make are the roads that we take...! 


#### Market research:

__- Who is your current competition?__
__- How is your product different from currently available competitors?__
__- What is the current supply / demand for your product?__


In the market of IT consultancy there are alot of competitors. You have the big 4 (PWC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY) and besides that alot of other really big consulting companies. There are also quite alot small IT consultancy companies. We will make sure that we will be different from all the others by giving it our personal swing to it. We will go the extra mile to make the clients very happy and satisfied. We need to make sure that the actual information that we share with everybody is high quality. We will only take consulting jobs when we know for sure that we can help the companies out with our advise. Otherwise we will let them know that the topic is not our expertise. 

Worldwide the IT  consulting market is responsible for 50 billion dollar. The forecast is that that is going to grow a few billion in the next couple of years. The demand of the consulting is by that growing. We will not focus on the bigger companies but have the focus more on the start-ups and scale-ups to gain focus. 



## Technical Specifications:

_- What data will you need to store? How will it be organized? Describe each table, its columns, and its relationships with other tables.
_- What does your product look like? List each view, their purpose, and how they work
- Describe any complex business logic that is happening in your application. For example, how does data flow through your application

First of all I want to mention that the main focus for the project will be on the frontend. I've been going through alot of consulting websites and they all have the main focus on the frontend. Itsnot really needed to make an account or login or anything. Because of the information that you will share you will deffinitly share in person to eachother. Main focus on the frontend and maybe if its nesseasary I can make a login page for companies that are actually a client of us. Here they can add some more information that they would like us to investigate for them. 

The product will look well designt and really user friendly. In that case It will attract alot of people that think nice job! I mean the site must be looking awesome for them to think we will hire rhis guys because they can do really cool stuff. 

There will be several pages, routes will be set up in order to brose everywhere. I will use Parallax to brose nicely throught the page.

- Create milestones that represent the discrete blocks of functionality.
